**Final Year Project 2025-2026 Computer Science**
The aim of the project is to develop a webapp for users to store, share and generate their own schedules. It will also allow them to automatically compare their scheudles with another user, making finding time for a joint activitiy that much easier.
The main complex part of the project comes from the schedule generation, as each different restraint or optional input for the user adds more depth and usefulness to the user.
